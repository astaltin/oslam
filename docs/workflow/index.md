# Flow

The flow of the billing system is as follows:

1. **Charge Recording**

   - Individual charges are entered into the "[Charge Slip](../terminologies.md#C)"
     sheet during patient services.

2. **Bill Summary Creation**

   - These charges are aggregated into the "[SOA](../terminologies.md#S)" sheet
     for patient or account-level billing summaries.

3. **Itemized [SOA](../terminologies.md#S) Details**

   - Detailed charges for each bill are recorded in the "Details [SOA](../terminologies.md#S)"
     sheet for transparency and record-keeping.

4. **[Collection](../terminologies.md#C) Tracking**

   - Payments received are logged into the "[Collection](../terminologies.md#C)"
     sheet, showing daily payment activity.

5. **Discount Application**

   - Discounts from the "Discount" sheet are applied where applicable.

6. **Price Verification**
   - For medication charges, the "Medicines" and "2024 MEDICINE PRICELIST"
     sheets ensure that pricing aligns with the current standards.
